# Circle Technical Assessment

**Both answers for questions one and two are outputted in the console. Follow steps for functioning live examples both showcased in the README below.**

### Question 1: 
Create a function that logs "Hello World" to the console every 10 seconds.

#### Steps for functioning live example:
 1. Navigate to the _hello.js_ file for the function
 2. To run the console application type _node hello.js_ into the terminal

### Question 2: 
Create a function that sets a cookie with an initial value of 0 on the page. Each time on
the page loads, add 1 to the cookie’s value and log it to the console. For example, the
value of the cookie would be 1 on the first page load, 2 on the second load, etc. Extra
Credit: On the page, create a button that resets the cookie’s value to 0 when clicked.

#### Steps for functioning live example:
1. Nagivate to the _cookie_ directory for the collection of files
2. Right click the file _index.html_ to open the live server
3. Open up the console by either shortcut key F12 or by right clicking the page and clicking inspect then navigating to console in the tabs

### Question 3:
Using Lucidchart or a similar diagramming tool, please draw out the logical flow of the
function in Question 2.

#### Steps for example:
1. Navigate to the Question2FlowChart pdf to view the logical flow inside of the root folder.

### Question 4:
Follow the steps in this guide to get a Circle API key and install the sample payments
application. Add a few of the pre-loaded cards to your sandbox account and generate a
list of all of the cards that have been added to your account via the API. Take a
screenshot of this list in the sample payments app and share it.

#### Steps for example:
In the root folder there contains two screenshots for the list of all cards, one that contains the entire 
page and one just of the response since one screenshot would not get the entire response from the API call.
1. Navigate to the two png files inside of the root folder.
